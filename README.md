# Ionic React Template
A GH template for my Ionic/React front ends. Automatically packages:

    @ross-alexandra/react-utilities
    lodash
    @emotion/styled

This react template uses Typescript, ESlint, & Jest.

## Development
For unknown reasons, using `ionic` with `capacitor` may not work with
live reload on any Android API < 29. Please ensure you're using API_29 or greater
to ensure that you will be able to develop with live reload (using `npm run start:android`).
